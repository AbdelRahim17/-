        <h3>Preparation Method</h3>
        <p>In a blender, add the milk and powdered sugar, blending well until the sugar dissolves completely.
            Add the eggs and oil, then blend again until the mixture is smooth and well combined.
            In a separate bowl, mix the coffee, salt, and cocoa powder until fully incorporated.
            Sift in the flour and baking powder, then mix well.
            Gradually add the liquid mixture to the dry ingredients while blending until a smooth cake batter forms.
            Pour the batter into a baking tray lined with parchment paper and bake in a preheated oven at 180Â°C for 25 minutes.
            Once baked, let the cake cool completely, then spread whipped cream evenly over it.
            Roll the cake carefully into a log shape, then drizzle with chocolate sauce.
            Refrigerate for at least 3 hours before serving.
            Enjoy your delicious Swiss Roll!</p>
