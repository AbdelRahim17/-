        <h3>Preparation Method</h3>
        <p>Boil the Potatoes: Place the sliced potatoes in a pot of salted water over medium heat and boil for 30
            minutes until fully cooked. Drain and mash until smooth. <br> Prepare the Meat Layer: In a pan over medium
            heat, add vegetable oil, then sauté the onions and garlic for 5 minutes until softened. Add the ground beef,
            salt, black pepper, and parsley, stirring well. Cook on low heat for 15 minutes until fully done. <br>
            Season the Mashed Potatoes: Mix the mashed potatoes with a little salt and black pepper until well combined.
            <br> Prepare the Béchamel Sauce: In a pot over medium heat, melt the butter, then add the flour and stir for
            1 minute. Gradually add the milk while stirring continuously to prevent lumps. Add salt, black pepper, and
            nutmeg, then let it simmer for 2 minutes until thickened. Remove from heat. <br> Assemble the Dish: <br>
            Line a baking tray with parchment paper. <br>
            Spread the mashed potatoes evenly in the tray. <br>
            Add the cooked meat layer on top. <br>
            Pour the béchamel sauce over the meat. <br>
            Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese on top. <br> Bake: Preheat the oven to 180°C and bake for 17 minutes
            until the cheese melts and turns golden.
            Serve: Remove from the oven, slice, and serve hot. Enjoy</p>
